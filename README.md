Divvy is a single-header component entity framework made in C++ that utilizes
C++11 features. Licensed under the MIT license and designed to be extremely
easy to integrate, it's purpose is to ease development where monolithic class
structures would normally be the answer.

Divvy was originally geared towards game development, but it can be used for
other areas of development as well.
